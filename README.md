The closest thing you can get to a caseoh web fan game. All credit goes to Lax1dude (Calder Young) for making the original game code,
Originally from [g.eags.us](https://g.deev.is/fnaw/) or [g.lax1dude.net](https://g.lax1dude.net/fnaw/), this is just a mirror because the original site was blocked.

This repo contains the "source", which is just some javascript code and a tarball with the assets in it.

#### From the original game code readme:
>My fnaf fan game where you play as the janitor at my school while these erasers with creepy faces and paperclip limbs hunt you down

Playable on Github pages.
